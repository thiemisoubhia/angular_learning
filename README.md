# ❤️ Hello Angular World! ❤️

This is my very first AngularJS project — made with care, curiosity, and lots of learning!
I'm currently learning Angular through the [**Simplilearn Angular Basics**](https://www.simplilearn.com/) course, and this little app is part of my journey.

>  A summary of my learning so far is available in the [`resume.pdf`](./resume.pdf) file! Check it out! 📄
